In UCLA Summer Session 2021, I took COM SCI 97 Course - Variable Topics in Computer Science: Introduction to Data Science. I learned  Python and college level statistics such as regression, regularization, and classifications. In 3 weeks of program, my team and I applied the concepts in creating a program that links people with similar music preference based on their playlist to help overcome potential depression during Pandemic. 

#### _Unfortunately, the python file of the project is lost..._
