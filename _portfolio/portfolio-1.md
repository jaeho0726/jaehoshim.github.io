#### As a passionate soccer enthusiast, soccer was beyond mere entertainment. My emotional state of the week depended on the outcome of Chelsea fixture. As a result, hoping Chelsea to perform the best as possible, I found myself asking the following question to myself. 

### _In what position should each player play in the field to show their absolute ability?_


First, I divided the filed into 22 distinct areas and reviewed all Chelsea games played in 2020-21 season and 2021-2022 season under manager Thomas Tuchel. (images) I meticulously recorded every instance of ball possession: **who** touched the ball in **what area** in **which game**. This data was recorded in Google Sheet. Utilizing this data, I created an interactive dashboard aiming to transform raw data to meaningful visualizations. 

The primiary feature of the dashboard is a customized touch map, which represents the overall touch percentage in each 22 distinct area for specific player (user input) throughout the season. Additionally, graphs provide further insight to the relationship between players' rating and area of ball possession. The first graph displays players' ratings for each game, showing entire ratings that a player received throughout the season. Other graph displays the relationship between the number of touches and player ratings for each area, accompanied by a line of best fit. These visualizations offer analytical capabilities. 

While creating the dashboard in Google Sheets provided valuable experience in Excel and data manipulation, I encountered limitations in fully expressing the project's intentions and conducing in-depth analysis. To address these limitations, I am curently in process of developing this project into a website.
