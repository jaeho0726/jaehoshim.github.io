#### As a passionate soccer fan, soccer was beyond entertainment. My emotion of the week depended on the result of Chelsea fixture of that week. Consequently, hoping Chelsea to perform the best as possible, I have asked the following question to myself. 

### _In what position should each player play in the field to show their absolute ability?_


First, I divided the filed into 22 areas. (images) I rewatched all the games played in 2020-21 season and 2021-2022 season under manager Thomas Tuchel and recorded **who** touched the ball in **what area** in **which game**. Data was recorded in Google Sheet (link). Based on data, I created interactive dashboard to transform data into meaningful ways such as visulization. First, the customized touch map represents the overall touch percentage for specific player (user input). Other visulization is just a graph of ratings of specific player (user input) for each game in 2020-21 season. Other visulization finds the relationship between number of touches and ratings for each area with line of best fit(user input). 

Creating dashboard using Google Sheet was a great opportunity to learn Excel and apply it into my interest. Still, I felt some limitations of using Excel to fully represent my intention of this project and analyze it. To better accomplish, I am currently working towards developing this project into actual website.
